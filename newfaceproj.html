                <p>This was my first hackathon project that took place during my first month at Northeastern called
                HuskyHack101. This was a beginner hackathon focused for those who had never done a hackathon before.
                I worked with a large group and we were ultimately invited to move on to full version of the hackathon
                after completing the beginner 4 hour version. We earned second place of the teams that advanced to the
                longer hack. We created a web application inspired by FeedShare, a crowd sourced free food finder. Users
                could make posts whenever they spotted our university president on campus and track him in real time.
                This was a goofy project that was a joy to be a part of, especially as a first hack.</p>

            <p>This was a project for Northeastern University's Wireless Club Hackathon and won the Best
                Algorithm award. Using Google's TensorFlow library for Python we generated metrics for kpop songs and
                trained our algorithm on a relatively small data set of about 100 songs. We ultimately reached an
                accuracy of between 70% and 80% which we were very happy with given such a small sample set. We
                decided on this strange topic as me and my partner were both fans of korean music in addition to the
                fact that the music was easier to form metrics for because of the varied use of english.</p>
