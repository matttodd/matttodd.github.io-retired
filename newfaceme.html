                <p>I grew up in <strong>Long Island, New York</strong> with my parents and older sister.
                    Throughout my childhood, I never got to travel much outside the occasional vacation a couple states
                    away. Between junior high and high school, I was finally able to explore more of the United States
                    through academic competitions. Going into college, I knew I wanted to have some experience abroad. I
                    spent half of my summer break after freshman year in <strong>Korea</strong>, studying and doing
                    research at <strong>Yonsei University</strong>. The experience abroad in a totally foreign culture
                    was experience I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>

                <p>Health has always been an important factor of my life which has lead me to spend a lot of time
                    being active. Most notably of late, I play basketball and racquetball in addition to being part of
                    <strong>Northeastern's Obstacle Course Racing team: Elite Heat</strong>. This club has introduced me
                    to the whole spectrum of personal wellness and we traveled to all sorts of gyms throughout Boston.
                    We've trained at an actual <strong>American Ninja Warrior</strong> gym and frequent a bouldering gym
                    just to name a few.</p>

                <p>In high school, <strong>Science Olympiad</strong> and <strong>FIRST Robotics</strong> were
                    where most of my free time went. During my 6 years with Sci-O, I went to 3 national competitions and
                    took home 2 national medals. My year in the FIRST Tech Challenge brought me and my team to the World
                    Competition. These clubs introduced me to technology as a hobby and passion rather than merely
                    subjects of school, as well as served as competitive fields for me <strong>crush other equally nerdy
                    teens</strong>.</p>
